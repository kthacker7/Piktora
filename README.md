Piktora is a simple augmented reality based shopping application where you can use images of products from Flipkart 
or your gallery and find out how the product looks on you or your surroundings by using your iPhone's camera or an image 
from your gallery. It is aimed at avid online shoppers who are looking for a way to do a trial for fashion products for 
themselves, or test out different home decor products.

Why stress on picturing how that new piece of furniture would look like when you can simply Pik it and use your iPhone's c
amera to check out how it looks in your living room? Simply choose a product, let the app work a little bit of magic, and 
voila! You have an amazing preview of how that new sofa is going to look in your living room!
